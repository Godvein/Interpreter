# My Interpreted Language in Python

This repository is a work-in-progress for creating an interpreted programming language using Python. Inspired by foundational concepts, this project is helping me dive deep into lexing, parsing, and interpreting code to better understand the inner workings of programming languages.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to build a basic interpreter that can tokenize user input, parse it according to predefined syntax rules, and evaluate expressions. This involves setting up a lexer, parser, and interpreter to process code written in our custom language.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the tutorial by [CodePulse](https://youtu.be/Eythq9848Fg?si=Ty6T7Bo4h5eMDKuS) for guiding this project. The tutorial has been invaluable in helping me understand key concepts and structure for language creation in Python.
